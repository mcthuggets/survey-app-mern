# survey-app-mern

Hello there!👋

This is another small project that I'm doing for the company facilitating my training.
I have chosen to use a MERN stack for this exercise 🍃🚅⚛🟢

The goals of the project are:

  1. Make a simple survey that:
     - Uses various input types (Single select, multi-select and text)
     - Saves users answers in a database somewhere
     - Performs input validation
     
  2. Make a single page that:
     - Lists the survey results with the time of submission
     - Has a button to download the results as a .csv file
  
  3. Add basic user authentication:
      - Hint: Use JSON web tokens
